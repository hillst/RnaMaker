TODO

Finish fixing the targetfinder tool.
This means,
Right now it returns json, but there is nothing to parse this json and return a result. Make sure you get this
done. Finally, it should be placed in the amiRNA_Suite package. It *could* stay in the default controller but that
is probably bad practice.

the generate list tool is an optional feature I believe, don't worry about it as much. The problem with generate
list is that it calls all of the tools and packages them into one. This is HARD, an alternative would be to 
rewrite this tool in a more managable form (currently it's hard to maintain)
