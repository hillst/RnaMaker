#SandboxedDaemon.py#
This directory contains all the files used to run the SandboxedDaemon. SandboxedDaemon is a persistant python application that listens for connections, once connections, it expects a json input. This json file should contain various information about the program you are trying to run remotely.

SandboxedDaemon also contains a queue, this queue only allows some number of jobs, determined at startup, to be run silmutaniously. SandboxedDaemon uses the Pipeline Module (pipeline_mod/pipeline.py) to decode the json and run the jobs asyncrhoniously.

For the Daemon to run, there must be a folder in THIS DIRECTORY called results. The most practical thing to do is add a symbolic link to a results folder in your webapp.

#Security#
To be sure nothing malicious is happening with the Daemon, give the daemon it's own user, and allow that user to only execute a specific set of proccesses.

#JSON#
The .json passed to the server from the client expects the following format:
{
    "<process name> (could be anything)>": {
        "path": "path/to/executable",
        "output": "file/to/write/stdout",
        "arguments": [
            "arg1", "arg2"
            "-orflag", "flagarg"
        ]
    }
}
